# Game-of-Life by Jacob Ellis
Implementation of Game of Life in Python 3 using Pygame

Tested successfully on Python 3.3.2 with Pygame 1.9.2a0 and Python 2.7.6 with Pygame 1.9.1release.

Left click to create squares, right click to delete. Press 'g' to toggle grid on and off. Up and down arrow keys raise and lower FPS, respectively. Spacebar starts and stops the game. Editing can only be done while the game is paused.
